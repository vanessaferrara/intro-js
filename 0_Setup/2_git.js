// Exercise Sheet 4: Git and GitHub. //
///////////////////////////////////////

// Here we assume that that you forked the repository of exercises into your
// own Github account (or at the very least that you have "pushing rights" to 
// a remote).

// EXERCISE 1. Git Push-Ups.
////////////////////////////

// You are now warmed up. It is time to look back at when you started
// this course. You were a different person, and so this was a different
// folder.

// a. Open the Git Panel:
// - For ATOM users: bottom right button.
// - For VSCode users: third icon from the top, on the left. 

// b. Visualize the changes you have made to the files in the folder.

// b. If you are happy with them "stage" them, that is add them to the index.

// c. Add a proper "commit" message to describe your changes. Be concise.

// d. Good! Your changes are saved. If you have the permissions to, you can 
// now push push your updated to your online repository.
